It's my very first room escape game. 

You basically have to know a thing or two about current european football trendings and issues worldwide. 

It is made of my imagination of someone who is madly in football gossips tries to trap the player or user, who has no idea what football is, inside his or her place for prank. 

It's easy if you are aware of Son, south-Korean world-class player and his idol growing as a kid. 

Thank you for playing.
